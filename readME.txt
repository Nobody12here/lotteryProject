Below is a guide to running the project locally.


To run an existing Vite.js project, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project's directory using the `cd` command. For example:
   
   cd path/to/your/vite-project
   

3. Install project dependencies by running either of the following commands, depending on your package manager of choice:

   - Using NPM:
     
     npm install
     
   - Using Yarn:
     
     yarn install
     

4. Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running the following command:
   
   npm run dev
    or 
   yarn dev
   

5. Vite.js will bundle and compile your project, and the development server will be up and running.

6. By default, the development server starts at `http://localhost:3000`. Open your web browser and navigate to this address.

7. You should see your Vite.js project running in the browser. Any changes you make to the code will automatically trigger hot module replacement (HMR), allowing you to see the updates without refreshing the page.

That's it! You have successfully started the Vite.js project and can now begin working on it. If you encounter any issues or have questions, consult the Vite.js documentation or seek help from the Vite.js community. Happy coding!
